# Biogeography-of-Metal-and-Antibiotic-Resistance-in-Aquatic-Environments


This repository holds code related to my thesis, a bioinformatics-based project looking at the distribution of antibiotic and metal resistance genes in aquatic environments. 
It is split into three modules:

1) downloading the data using the MG-RAST-Toolkit
2) modifying the file names
3) Parameters and code used to run ARGs-oap v.3.0 to generate counts of ARGs and MRGs

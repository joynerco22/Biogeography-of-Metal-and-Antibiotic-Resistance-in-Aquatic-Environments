# Biogeography-of-Metal-and-Antibiotic-Resistance-in-Aquatic-Environments

Welcome to my GitHub page! My name is Cory Joyner, and I am a M.Sc Biology student with a strong background in microbial genomics, genomic data analysis, with a strong interest in studying the interplay between humans, their environment, and contaminant exposure. 

This repository holds code related to my thesis, a bioinformatics-based project looking at the distribution of antibiotic and metal resistance genes in aquatic environments. It is a large scale, billion-base pair analysis using NGS sequencing data but it also contains helper scripts in the command line, Python, and R. I have had a blast working through this, and I hope you find it interesting as well! 

1) downloading the data using the MG-RAST-Toolkit
2) modifying the file names
3) Parameters and code used to run ARGs-oap v.3.0 to generate counts of ARGs and MRGs
